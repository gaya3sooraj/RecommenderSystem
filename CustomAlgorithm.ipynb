    "AlgoBase in the Surprise library contains all the prediction algorithms like SVD, KNN. Here is more information about [AlgoBase](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/algobase.html#surprise.prediction_algorithms.algo_base.AlgoBase). It is quite easy to build our own algorithm using Surprise. In this report we will use a custom algorithm and compare its performance with the in-built SVD algorithm."
